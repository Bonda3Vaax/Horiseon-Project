# Horiseon Project 
## _Refactoring Website_

Refactoring existing code by improving it without changing what it does in order to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. 

For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

To impress clients, I should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability by checking that all links are functioning correctly and also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

# Features

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
